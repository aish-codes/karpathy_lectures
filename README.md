* This repo is a reconstruction of Karpathy's lectures covering the playlist Neural Networks Zero to Hero using words from the novel A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens
  
* Pre-requisites for this notebook are below:
1. Basic Python
2. Tensors
3. Calculus
   
* Rather than building on basics this notebook would instead act as a refresher on the subject of neural networks
